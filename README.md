Brain Wave

**Brain Wave** is an interactive app that uses AI to analyze childrenâ€™s breathing patterns and detect early signs of stress or depression. Through fun breathing games, the app silently tracks breath and alerts parents if irregular patterns are detected, enabling early intervention without making the child feel observed.

## Features:
- AI-powered breath analysis to detect early signs of stress.
- Fun and engaging breathing games that promote emotional regulation.
- Quick alerts to parents for early intervention.
- Easy-to-use interface designed for children.

## Technologies Used:
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Analyzing breathing patterns to detect early signs of stress.
- **User Interface**: Designed to be fun and interactive for children.
- **Smart Notifications**: Alerts sent to parents when abnormal patterns are detected.

## How It Works:
Children play games that encourage deep breathing while the app silently analyzes their breath. If irregular patterns are detected, the app sends gentle notifications to the parents, allowing early intervention without making the child feel observed.

## Future Plans:
- Develop additional tools for tracking mood and behavior.
- Add multilingual support to reach a global audience.
- Integrate with wearable devices like wristbands or headphones.
- Partner with schools and mental hea

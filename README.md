# Brain wave 🧠
Brain Wave

**Brain Wave** is an interactive app that uses AI to analyze children’s breathing patterns and detect early signs of stress or depression. Through fun breathing games, the app silently tracks breath and alerts parents if irregular patterns are detected, enabling early intervention without making the child feel observed.


## Team Objectives:
- Innovate a smart tool that enables early detection of psychological challenges in children.
- Strengthen non-verbal communication between children and parents through breath analysis.
- Integrate mental wellness into enjoyable, child-friendly experiences.
- Provide a preventive solution that acts before emotional crises escalate.
- Create a positive social impact that starts at the family level and scales to the community.

## Idea Overview:
**Brain Wave** is an interactive mobile application that uses artificial intelligence to analyze children’s breathing patterns and detect early signs of stress or depression. Children play games that involve breathing—such as blowing a balloon or moving a cloud—while the app quietly analyzes their breath. If the system detects irregular or stressed breathing, it sends gentle alerts to the parents, enabling early and compassionate intervention without making the child feel observed.

## Future Plans:
- Develop more advanced emotional tracking tools that monitor mood and behavioral patterns.
- Launch multilingual versions to reach a global audience.
- Integrate with wearable smart devices like wristbands or headphones.
- Form partnerships with schools and psychological clinics to embed **Brain Wave** in daily child routines.
- Create custom analytical reports for parents using visual dashboards and behavioral insights.

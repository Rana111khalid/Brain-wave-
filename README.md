# Brain-wave
Brain Wave is an interactive app that uses AI to analyze childrenâ€™s breathing patterns and detect early signs of stress or depression. Through fun breathing games, the app silently tracks breath and alerts parents if irregular patterns are detected, enabling early intervention without making the child feel observed.
